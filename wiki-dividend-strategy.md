## 3️⃣ The High Yield Strategy

### What is It?
Focusing on stocks with high dividend yields.

### What's "High"?
```
Normal: 1-3% yield
High: 4-6% yield
Very High: >6% yield (be careful!)
```

### How to Find
1. Use Dividend Tracker filters
2. Sort by Yield % (highest first)
3. Research why yield is high
4. Verify dividend sustainability

### Important: Why Are Yields High?

**Reason 1: Quality Company, Good Return**
- ✓ Established company
- ✓ Good fundamentals
- ✓ Sustainable dividend
- ✓ Stock price maybe temporarily down

**Reason 2: Company in Trouble** ⚠️
- ✗ Company struggling
- ✗ Dividend might be cut
- ✗ Stock price falling fast
- ✗ Yield looks high but risky

### Red Flags for High Yields
```
✗ Dividend increases while earnings fall
✗ Payout ratio >100%
✗ Stock price down 50%+ recently
✗ Warnings from analysts
✗ One-time special dividend inflating yield
```

### Example: High Yield Selection

```
Company A: 6% yield
├─ PE Ratio: 12 (cheap)
├─ Market Cap: ₹50,000 Cr (large)
├─ 5-year dividend growth: +15%/year
└─ Assessment: ✓ SAFE - High yield with quality

Company B: 8% yield
├─ PE Ratio: 3 (very cheap)
├─ Market Cap: ₹2,000 Cr (small)
├─ Dividend down 20% last year
└─ Assessment: ✗ RISKY - High yield but fundamentals weak
```

### Best For
- Income-focused investors
- Retirees
- Conservative investors
- Those seeking immediate cash flow

### Strategy Mix
```
Safe High Yield (4-5%):     ✓ 60% of portfolio
Moderate Yield (2-3%):      ✓ 30% of portfolio
Growth (0-2%):              ✓ 10% of portfolio

Result: 3.5% average yield, lower risk
